# Introduction to Java

## Overview

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that has become one of the most popular and widely-used programming languages in the world. Known for its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy, Java has revolutionized software development since its inception.

## History of Java

### The Birth of Java

Java was originally developed by **James Gosling** at Sun Microsystems (which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010). The project began in June 1991 as part of the "Green Project" - a small team effort to create a new programming language for digital devices.
